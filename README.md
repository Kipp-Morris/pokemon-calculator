# pokemon-calculator
A four-operation calculator for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance written in C.

In my Intro to Computer Systems and Organization class we did an assignment where we created a small GBA game and used it as a way to learn some of the basics of having to think about hardware while programming. It was also meant to help us become more used to programming in C, since GBA games are written in either C or C++. Since that assignment was small in terms of the amount of time we spent on it and I honestly did a lot of it without totally understanding how the underlying hardware of the GBA worked, this calculator project that I took on on my own was a way for me to practice C programming while also learning more about the GBA.

To that end, I'll use this space to explain some of the more important parts of what I did, what I learned, and how I would extend this project if I had more time.
